### Description

This tutorial loosely follows the react router tutorial [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial#nested-routes). I have decided to expand on it. We will be building a contact list using react router features. There will be a video series that will show you how to properly set up and host a React + Vite app with react router that goes along with this written version.
